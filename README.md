# MinimaxChessBot_v2

## ðŸ§© Chess Bot Description

This Python script simulates a basic chess bot using the `python-chess` library. It includes three key components:

1. **Random Move Bot**: Simulates a chess game by making random legal moves until the game ends.
2. **Minimax and Alpha-Beta Algorithms**: Implements decision-making algorithms to determine optimal moves based on board evaluation up to a specified depth.
3. **Board Evaluation Function**: Assigns scores to board states based on material advantage, evaluating piece counts for both players.


The code provides a foundation for building a more sophisticated chess bot by combining move selection algorithms and board analysis.
